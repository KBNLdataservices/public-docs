You are now on the [```gh-pages``` branch](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages) of this repo. The files on this branch run the (sub)site [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs). These are the pages under the **Documentation link** in the top navigation on [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/).

## Contributing to this repo
If you want to contribute to this production repo (typically .md files for documentation, code, manuals etc.) you are kindly requested to follow these steps:

1) Go to the ```gh-pages``` branch of the public-docs staging & test repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging/tree/gh-pages) to develop & test your contributions. 

2) You can visualize/preview your contributions via the staging site at [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs-staging](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs-staging). 

3) Once you have tested & previewed your contributions and you think they are OK for production, you can submit them (via a pull request with a dedicated branch) to [this production repo](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages). 

4) Once your submission has been approved by the admins of the production repo, you will see them in the  production site at [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs).

Besides this documentation repo, there is also the [kbnldataservices.github.io](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/tree/gh-pages) repo, that from its ```gh-pages``` branch serves the subsite [https://kbnldataservices.github.io](https://kbnldataservices.github.io). This repo and subsite hold the following two groups of pages: 

**1) Blog - news and updates**
* Blog home / latest articles: [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog), redirected from [https://kbnldataservices.github.io](https://kbnldataservices.github.io), corresponding to [this file](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_pages/index.md) in the repo
