# KBNLdataservices / public-docs 

<img alt="KB logo" src="assets/images/KB_Nationale-Bibliotheek_Logo_RGB-Zwart-EN.jpg" width="400px" align="right"/>

*Public documentation, code, insights, tips & tricks about the public datasets and collections of the KB, the national library of the Netherlands.*  

The documentation subsite you are currently on is formed by the pages under the **Documentation link** in the above top navigation.

It is served from the ```gh-pages``` branch of the repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages).

## Contributing to this site
If you want to contribute to this site (typically .md files for documentation, code, manuals etc.) you are kindly requested to follow these steps:

1) Go to the ```gh-pages``` branch of the public-docs staging & test repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging/tree/gh-pages) to develop & test your contributions. 

2) You can visualize/preview your contributions via the staging site at [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs-staging](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs-staging). 

3) Once you have tested & previewed your contributions and you think they are OK for production, you can submit them (via a pull request with a dedicated branch) to the production repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages). 

4) Finally, once your submission has been approved by the admins of the production repo, you will see them in this site.
